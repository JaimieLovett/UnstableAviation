# Unstable Aviation
Unstable Aviation was my submission to the Ludum Dare 49 game jam in which the theme was "unstable".

## Description

You're in control of an unstable spaceship. Your ship has two modes: SHOOT and ACCELERATE. Staying in either mode for too long will cause your ship to explode so be sure to keep switching between modes before the weapon or engine stability reach 0. Switching modes will reset stability to 100% and grant you a temporary immunity shield.

## Controls

Rotate - Left/Right Arrow Keys
Switch Modes (Accelerate / Shoot) - Spacebar
Menu Navigation - Up/Down Arrow Keys
Menu Selection - Enter
